      <p>
        I'm a third year mathematics student at UC Berkeley.
        My mathematical interests include functional analysis, category theory, and smooth manifolds.
        Aside from that, I play guitar and chess. My username on <a href="\\www.chess.com">chess.com</a> is nicksspark.
        I have experience with web development, in particular React-Redux, as well as deep learning.
