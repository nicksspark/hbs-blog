        I'm a third year mathematics student at UC Berkeley.
        My mathematical interests include real analysis, category theory, and smooth manifolds. Also topology of all flavors.
        Aside from that, I play guitar and chess. My username on <a href="\\www.chess.com">chess.com</a> is nicksspark.
        I have experience with web development, in particular <a href="\\redux.js.org">React-Redux</a>.
        <!-- Currently, I am working on a computer vision project involving
        <a href="\\www.cs.toronto.edu/polyrnn/">Polygon-RNN++</a> and
        <a href="\\mxnet.apache.org/">MXNet</a>. -->
